<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spelled Arrestor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-line</li><li>End-of-line</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Spelled Arrestor market comprises two primary types: in-line and end-of-line arrestors. In-line arrestors are installed directly in the power line to provide continuous protection against voltage surges during operation. They effectively mitigate transient overvoltages while the system is active. Conversely, end-of-line arrestors are placed at the terminal points of a circuit, protecting equipment from voltage spikes that occur at the end of the line. Both types ensure the safety and longevity of electrical systems.</p></p>
